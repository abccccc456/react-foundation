### The Definition

What is React.js?

> It’s not about templates, or data binding, or DOM manipulation. It’s about using functional programming with a virtual DOM representation to build ambitious, high-performance apps with JavaScript.

### MVC

React.js is not a model-view-controller (MVC) framework/library.

# You need to bring your own models and routers.

## React.js can work with other MVC-like framework such as Backbone.js and Angular.js.

---


## React.js is often used with Flux and React Router.
